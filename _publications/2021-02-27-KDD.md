This paper introduce an new problem on table: extracting numerical formula from table based on the text (not the numbers).

This task is the third one of a series of work on automatic numerical cross-checking ([WWW 2018](https://yixuancao.github.io/publication/2018-05-15-WWW-formula-extraction), [KDD 2020](https://yixuancao.github.io/publication/publication/2021-02-27-KDD))

It aims at extracting the numerical formula inside a table based on its visual and text information (not on the numbers). It can be used to identify numerical errors in tables, as well as suggest formulas during table editing.  

We also release a dataset on this problem. Please refer to the paper for more details about the model and the data.
