This paper introduce a noval and challange NLP problem: nested relation extraction.

An example of nested relation expressed in natural language is as follows:

We formulate Nested Relation Extraction ss a DAG structure extraction problem, and propose an Iterative Neural Network for this problem. The Iterative Neural Network extracts nested relations layer by layer iteratively.
