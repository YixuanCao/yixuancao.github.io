Automatically solving math word problem is a long studied problem in artificial intelligence research area.

We find that this problem can be viewed as a special case of [nested relation extraction problem](https://yixuancao.github.io/publication/2019-09-27-CIKM-nested-relation-extraction), as the math expresion and equation system is intrinsically a structure.

So, we borrow the bottom-up layer-by-layer extraction model from nested relation extraction, and it works well on both arithmetic and algebra problems. It achieves SOTA performance on MATH23K and DRAW1K (without external data).
